# Jazz 2.0 — Personal Dashboard PWA

A single-file mobile web app consolidating the Jazz 2.0 series (previously separate
Word docs) into one tabbed, installable PWA: **Home, To-Do, Skin & Hair, Wardrobe, Wants.**

## Files
- `index.html` — redirects to `jazz2.0.html`, so the bare repo root URL works instead
  of falling through to GitHub Pages' auto-rendered README
- `jazz2.0.html` — the entire app (HTML/CSS/JS, no build step, no framework)
- `manifest.json` — PWA manifest (name, icons, standalone display)
- `sw.js` — service worker, caches all 6 files for offline use
- `icon-192.png` / `icon-512.png` — generated app icons (true-black terminal-window
  card, gradient "J", raised white-gradient "2.0", blinking cursor block, cyan/magenta/
  lime gradient ring border)

## Status / how to deploy
Live at **https://jazz-h.github.io/Jazz2.0/** (GitHub Pages, deployed from `main` /
root). The manifest + service worker only register on a real http(s) origin, so this
didn't work from a local file or sandboxed preview — now that it's hosted, "Add to
Home Screen" on mobile should work from the URL above.

Home screen icon shortcuts (long-press the installed app icon): **Add a to-do**
(opens the To-Do tab and focuses the quick-add field; old installs whose shortcut still says `tab=home` land there too), **Today's routine** (Skin & Hair, which
then auto-scrolls to today), **Wardrobe**, **Wants**. A true live-data Android
home screen widget isn't possible from a web app — that needs a native app wrapper,
out of scope for this project — so these shortcuts are the PWA equivalent. Implemented
via manifest.json's `shortcuts` array (each pointing at `jazz2.0.html?tab=...`) plus an
`applyLaunchParams()` function in the app that reads `?tab=`/`?action=` on load,
switches tabs accordingly, and strips the query string afterward via
`history.replaceState`.

## Design system
"Graphite" theme (replaced the original neon "Neon Nights" palette in Oct 2026): neutral
charcoal ground, bg `#0c0c0d`, surface `#161618`, surface-2 `#1d1d20`, surface-3
`#232327`, line `#2c2c31`. Text: `#f2f2f3` primary, `#8e8e96` dim. Accents: pastel blue
`#93c5fd` (AM / skincare), pastel pink `#f9a8d4` (PM), soft white `#f2f2f3` (primary
interactive accent — checkboxes, active tab, buttons, edit-mode toggle, with `#111113`
glyphs on top), danger `#f87171`. Picked from four alternatives (Midnight, Ember,
Graphite, Daylight) rendered side-by-side against the real app.

Every color in the app derives from the `:root` tokens — tints use `color-mix()` on
the accent tokens and checkmark glyphs inherit `currentColor` — so changing themes only
means editing that one block (plus `theme-color` in the HTML and `manifest.json`). The
token names are historical (`--gold` = AM, `--navy` = PM, `--olive` = primary accent).
Links use their own `--link` token (pastel blue) so they stay distinguishable from
body text, which shares the soft-white primary accent. App icons (redrawn in Graphite
colors in Oct 2026; earlier versions were neon):
a plain terminal-window card (charcoal, rounded square, no border, three status dots in
pink/gray/blue) with a "J2.0" wordmark in DejaVu Sans Mono Bold — the "J" in a pastel
blue→pink gradient fill, "2.0" smaller and raised like an exponent with a white→soft-gray
gradient for a bit of depth, plus a solid soft-white cursor block after it. Regenerated
by a Pillow script (drawn at 2048px, downsampled to 512/192). The card sits at 17% margin from the
canvas edge (not the ~9% of earlier drafts) — Android's maskable-icon safe zone is
roughly the center 66%-diameter circle, and the tighter margin was getting its corners
cropped and looking "zoomed in" next to other home-screen icons once actually installed
on a phone. Went through several rounds (flat "J2" → glowing lime "J2.0" → gradient-
ring-bordered terminal card → this, border removed) — see chat history if revisiting.
- Bottom tab bar (app-style), swipe left/right between tabs supported
- Pull-to-refresh (swipe down from the top of a tab) triggers a hard refresh — clears
  the service worker's cache and unregisters it before reloading, so it can't serve
  stale cached assets (native browser pull-to-refresh is disabled via
  `overscroll-behavior-y:none` so this custom one doesn't fight with it)
- Service worker uses network-first for the HTML shell (`jazz2.0.html`/`index.html`)
  and cache-first for static assets (icons, manifest) — first ship of the service
  worker was cache-first for everything, which meant a stale cached copy of the app
  could keep serving itself indefinitely (including hiding fixes shipped after it,
  like pull-to-refresh itself not working until this was fixed); registration also
  passes `updateViaCache: "none"` so the browser always re-checks `sw.js` itself for
  changes instead of caching it for up to 24h
- Standardized chevron pattern for ALL collapsible sections (rules cards, day
  accordions, capsule need/owned cards) — same SVG path, same 180° rotate-on-open
  behavior
- Every collapsible section shows an "insight" (count/progress) in its header,
  except the Skin & Hair day accordions — the AM/PM step-count insight was removed
  per user preference
- Desktop layout (`@media (min-width: 768px)`, CSS-only): the tab bar moves from the
  bottom to a horizontal bar under the header (icon + label side by side, lime
  underline on the active tab), and header/tabs/content align on one centered 760px
  column instead of stretching full-width; edit modals center on screen instead of
  bottom-sheeting. Phone layout is untouched below the breakpoint

## Editing
Every list in the app — Skin & Hair rules and AM/PM steps, Style fit rules/sizing/capsule
items, Wants items — is fully editable in-app: add, edit, and delete, no code changes
needed. Tap the pencil icon top-right of the header to enter edit mode. While it's on:
- Rows with no existing tap action (rules, skin/hair steps, sizing) become tappable —
  tap anywhere on the row to edit or delete it.
- Rows that already have a primary tap action (capsule owned/needed toggle, wants
  mark-bought) get a small separate pencil button so editing doesn't collide with
  that action.
- "+ Add …" buttons appear at the bottom of every list (Skin & Hair's 7 weekdays are NOT
  addable/removable, since "today" and wash-day detection depend on the fixed Mon–Sun
  set matching real calendar weekdays).
- New AM steps are inserted before the last step if that step's label contains "last
  step" (so SPF/lash-serum ordering rules stay intact automatically).
- Edits use a bottom-sheet modal with Save/Delete; deleting always confirms first.
Edit mode itself persists across reloads (`edit-mode` in localStorage).

## Data / storage
Two layers, both plain `localStorage`, both survive a hard refresh (pull-to-refresh
only clears the service worker's cache, never localStorage):
- **Content** (the editable lists themselves): `skin-rules-content`, `skin-routine-content` (legacy: `skin-days-content`),
  `style-rules-content`, `sizes-content`, `capsule-content`, `wants-content`,
  `todo-content`. Each seeds from the built-in defaults on first run (`todo-content`
  seeds empty — no default to-dos), then persists whatever the user edits it to.
- **State** (checkbox/toggle state, keyed by item id): `style-state`, `wants-state`.
  (Originally used `window.storage`, an artifact-only API from Claude's in-browser
  preview environment; migrated to `localStorage` now that the app runs on its own
  hosted origin — this also resolved the intermittent "Storage set failed" errors,
  since saves no longer go through Anthropic's artifact storage bridge at all.)

Removing the Fitness tab left `fitness-days-content` and `fitness-state` as orphaned
keys in any browser that had already loaded the app — harmless (nothing reads them
anymore), not actively cleaned up.

**Cross-device sync (opt-in, via GitHub Gist).** `localStorage` is per-browser-per-
device, so out of the box the phone PWA and the desktop site each keep independent
copies. The cloud button in the header turns on sync: the app stores all content/state
keys as one JSON file (`jazz2-data.json`, with an `updatedAt` stamp) in a private gist
on your GitHub account, pushes ~1.5s after every save, and pulls on load and whenever
the app returns to the foreground. Conflicts are last-write-wins on `updatedAt`.
Setup is pasting a **classic** personal access token with only the `gist` scope into
the sync modal on each device (fine-grained tokens can't use the Gist API). The token
and gist id live in `sync-token` / `sync-gist-id` in localStorage and are never synced
themselves; turning sync off deletes them but keeps all data. The service worker
deliberately ignores cross-origin requests so it can never serve stale GitHub API
responses from cache.

**Backup.** The same cloud button opens "Sync & backup", which also has **Download
backup** / **Restore…** — one JSON file (`{app:"jazz2", version, exportedAt, data}`)
holding the full live value of every synced list, including ones still on their
built-in defaults, so a restore truly replaces everything. Works with or without sync.
Download uses the share sheet where the browser supports sharing files (installed iOS
PWAs handle plain downloads poorly), else a normal download. A restore confirms first
and counts as a real edit, so with sync on it propagates to the other device.

## Tab-by-tab content
**Home:** The default landing tab. Its first card is a **To-Do summary**: just what
needs attention now — overdue and due-today items (up to 3, overdue first), each with
its own checkbox so it can be completed (with Undo) without leaving Home — plus a
footer like "2 more on your list". Tapping anywhere else on the card opens the To-Do
tab. Below it: today's routine, the Wardrobe/Wants tiles, and Up next.

**To-Do:** Its own tab (second in the bar) holding the full list described below —
quick-add, date groups, drag-to-reorder, sub-items, and the Completed section. The full
list moved off Home so Home stays a glanceable dashboard; `renderHome()` re-renders
both pages, so any to-do change refreshes Home's summary too.

*To-Do* — plain-text quick-add (type + Enter, no modal, mirrors the Wants quick-add
pattern and the gist of the Android Reminders "type a new line" flow). A trailing day
word sets a due date — "dentist fri", "call mom tomorrow", "pay rent by today" — with a
"Due Friday ×" preview chip under the input while typing; tapping × keeps the words as
plain text. New items go to the top of their group so they land in view.

Each to-do has a real due date (`due`, local `YYYY-MM-DD`, or null). Groups, in order,
only showing those with items: **Overdue** (red, sorted by date, each row shows its
date), **Today**, **Anytime** (no date — the quick-add default), **Tomorrow**, the next
five weekdays by name, and **Later** (beyond a week, sorted by date, rows show the date).
Dragging a row under another group's header moves it to that date (dropping under
Overdue/Later reorders without changing the date). Older data stored a bare weekday
name in `day`; it's converted once on load to that weekday's next occurrence (today
included). The To-Do tab shows every open item (no preview cap).

The checkbox (left) is the only thing that completes a to-do, followed by a 5-second
Undo toast (and a short vibration on Android); tapping the text opens the edit modal:
a wrapping title field (Enter saves), a native date picker (clear it for Anytime), and
an "Add sub-items — one per line" box. The card header shows "N open · M overdue" and
isn't collapsible. Row controls have ~44px touch targets. No default/seed items — it's
empty until you add your own.

Startup housekeeping — this date conversion and the 7-day auto-archive — saves
without bumping the sync timestamp (`writeQuietly`). Bumping it made a device that
opened with stale data look newest, so its sync pushed the stale copy over the other
device's real edits.

Each to-do also carries a couple of Android-Reminders-style extras, scoped down from
the full Reminders feature set to what's realistic in an installable web app with no
push-notification backend (see the "What this app can't do" note below): a **star**
toggle that floats the item to the top of its group, and a
**sub-checklist** toggle (the small list icon, shown only once a to-do has sub-items,
with a "done/total sub-items" line under the title; sub-items are first added from the
edit modal) that expands an inline mini checklist under the row — its own add-input,
per-item checkboxes, and a × to delete a sub-item, all independent of the parent
to-do's own completion state. Checking a to-do off no longer deletes it or just sinks
it in place — it moves into a collapsible **Completed** section (a "N completed" toggle at the foot of the to-do card),
showing the completion date; unchecking it there moves it right back (that's the
"Restore"), and each row also has **Duplicate** (clones it as a fresh open item,
including a fresh copy of its sub-items) and **Delete** (permanent, confirms first)
icon buttons. A red-outlined "Clear completed" button at the bottom of that card
bulk-deletes everything in it.

*What this app can't do:* a real Reminders app can alert you at a specific time or when
you arrive somewhere, because it's a native app with OS-level background access. This
is a static installable web page with no server — there's no reliable way for it to
wake up and fire a notification while it isn't open (iOS Safari blocks this almost
entirely even when "installed" to the home screen), so due-time alerts and
location-based reminders were deliberately left out rather than half-built.

*Glance cards* — tappable cards summarizing the other tabs and jumping straight to them
on tap, each with a colored icon badge for quick visual identity: **Today** (cyan
leaf/droplet badge — today's AM/PM steps from Skin & Hair, listed by a short display
name — a middle ground between the vague step category ("Eye area") and the full
product name with its concentration ("Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG"): "Cleanser,
Ascorbyl Glucoside, Niacinamide, Moisturizer, Hair mist, Sunscreen" — each list under a
small colored AM/PM tag — cyan for AM, magenta for PM, matching the accent colors used
for the actual AM/PM bands on the Skin & Hair tab — plus a wash-day badge on wash
Thursdays, or otherwise a highlighted "Next wash day: [date] — in N days" callout (a
magenta-tinted pill with a droplet icon, matching the PM accent color, so it stands out
from the rest of the card instead of reading as another dim detail line)), full-width
as before.

Below that, **Wardrobe** (lime shirt badge) and **Wants** (magenta bag badge) sit side
by side in a compact two-column stat-tile grid rather than stacking full-width — this
fills what used to be dead space at the bottom of Home and gives each card a distinct
accent color at a glance. Wardrobe shows owned% as the headline stat (with the
owned/total count as a caption) over a cyan→lime gradient progress bar, plus a "still
need" teaser naming the *cheapest* still-needed item by price when any needed items
have a price set, otherwise just the first one. Wants shows the pending dollar total as
the headline stat (with the pending count as a caption), plus a "next" teaser naming
the cheapest pending item. Both teasers truncate the item name to one line so the price
never gets crowded out, and both carry the same pair of inline icon-only actions at a
36px tap target (bumped up from an initial 28px, which measured under the ~44px
minimum touch-target guideline): a mark-owned/mark-bought checkmark button (olive), and
— only when that item has a link saved — a link-shortcut button in cyan, so it reads as
a distinctly different action from the checkmark rather than a second, easy-to-miss
duplicate; both glyphs share the same stroke width so they read as a matched pair. All
tiles re-render every time you land on Home, so they never show stale numbers from
something you changed on another tab.

The Skin & Hair, Wardrobe, and Wants tabs each carry a small colored icon badge next to
their header title (cyan droplet, lime shirt, magenta bag) matching the accent used for
their Home glance card, for visual continuity across the app.

**Skin & Hair:** Built around doing the routine, not just reading it. Cards, top to bottom:
- **Today** — today's AM and PM steps as a checklist (44px rows; tap anywhere on a row),
  each band with a "done/total" count, a "Wash day" badge when it applies, and a
  "N-day streak" (consecutive days with both AM and PM finished; today counts once it's
  done). Finishing a band shows "Morning/Evening routine done". Check-offs reset each
  day, sync across devices (`routine-checks`, keyed by date, ~60 days kept), and record
  `amDone`/`pmDone` at tick time so editing the routine later doesn't rewrite history.
- **This week** — Mon–Sun rows showing only what differs from the base routine
  ("Exfoliate", "Wash day", or "Base routine"), a check on fully finished days; tap a day
  for its complete AM/PM list.
- **Routine** — the single place to edit (Edit chip): AM, PM, and Wash-day PM steps.
  A step can be limited to certain days via a Mon–Sun chip picker in its edit form (all
  off = every day), shown as "Mon · Wed · Fri only". New steps go before a "… — last step"
  entry so SPF and lash serum stay last.
- **Key rules** — Vitamin C/Glycolic Acid different-session rule, SPF always last AM step,
  lash serum always last PM step.

Data model (`skin-routine-content`): `{washDay, am:[step], pm:[step], washPm:[step]}`, a
step being `{id, label, product, note?, days?}` (`days` = weekday numbers, 0 = Sun).
Wash-day PM replaces PM on wash days. This replaced seven full per-day copies
(`skin-days-content`), where changing a product meant editing up to 14 lists. Until the
routine is first edited it's derived on load from those legacy lists (or the built-in
`DEFAULT_SKIN_DAYS`) by `routineFromDays()`, which merges the seven days into one ordered
list and records which days each step appeared on; migrated step ids are hashes of their
text, so every device derives identical ids and synced check-offs line up. HTML entities
in the old data (`&amp;`) are decoded to plain text, and text is escaped on render.
Synced or restored data from an older app version (per-day lists, no routine) rebuilds
the routine from those lists. Verified equal to the old per-day output across 28
consecutive dates, wash and non-wash Thursdays included.

Hair mist (Locsanity Passion Fruit Daily Spray) runs AM (before SPF) and PM every day.
Wash day (Dollylocks shampoo + Mielle mask) runs biweekly on Thursday, anchored to Thu
Jul 16, 2026 (`WASH_DAY_ANCHOR`); on wash days the wash-day PM replaces the regular PM.
The anchor is a code constant.

**Wardrobe:** The closet plus reference info. Top card: "Wardrobe built" progress
(closet items ÷ closet + wardrobe items still to buy) and a "6 wardrobe items to buy ·
Shopping list →" link that opens Wants filtered to Wardrobe. **In closet** (open by
default) lists everything you own, grouped by category (Tops/Bottoms/Shoes/Outerwear/
Accessories), with "fit pending" badges, optional price/link, and an Edit chip for
editing, adding, or deleting closet items. Then Fit rules (front-tuck, Tall/Long inseam,
size-to-hips, no oversized/drop-shoulder, ankle dress pants = business casual only w/
no-show socks + loafers never sneakers) and the Sizing grid (Tops XS–S, Outerwear XXS,
Bottoms 4 Tall/Long, Denim 4/27 Long, Shoes 7.5M, Ring 5–7 w/ footnote: Oura confirmed
at 7).

**One shopping list.** There's no separate wardrobe "Still need" list anymore: clothes to
buy live on Wants with a wardrobe category (`wardrobeCat`, e.g. "Tops"). The closet is
derived, not copied — `closetItems()` = owned capsule items + wardrobe wants marked
bought — so marking a wardrobe want bought puts it in the closet ("Added to your
closet") and un-marking takes it back out. Older data kept "needed" items inside the
capsule (plus `style-state` toggles from the old tap-to-own UI); `migrateWardrobeNeeds()`
moves them onto Wants with derived ids (`w-` + capsule id, so every device gets the same
result), folds the original duplicate brown belt (wardrobe "Brown/cognac belt" + wants
"Brown leather belt, square buckle") into the one Wants entry, and clears `style-state`.
It saves quietly and also runs on synced/restored data from an older app version.

**Wants:** The single shopping list for everything, clothes included. Filter chips under
the quick-add — **All**, **Wardrobe**, **Other**, each with its count — narrow the list (the
Wardrobe tab's shopping link opens it on Wardrobe; quick-adding while on Wardrobe tags the
item "Wardrobe · Other"). Wardrobe items show a "Wardrobe · Tops"-style tag ("· in closet"
once bought), and every want's add/edit form has a Category select (Not clothing, or a
wardrobe category). Unpriced items show no price line. Home's Wants tile marks a
partial total with "+" and an "N unpriced" note; Home's Up next shows the top two items by
priority then price, wardrobe or not. A quick-add bar sits at the top of the tab, always available regardless of
edit mode — type a name and hit Enter (or tap the + button) to drop a new pending item
straight onto the list with no modal, no price/link required upfront; focus stays in
the field so you can add several in a row. (Edit mode's "+ Add want" still exists for
filling in price/link/notes upfront in one form.) Cytac holster ($24.99), Instant Pot
Duo 3qt ($59.99), North Face Antora
jacket gray XXS ($130, Dick's), Timberland Linden Woods boot black 7.5M ($139.99,
Rack Room), Oura Ring 5 + membership ($468.99), brown leather belt square buckle
(~$20 est., unconfirmed, pending decision on whether to merge with the style capsule's
separate brown/cognac belt line item). Pending and Purchased are collapsible cards
(matching the pattern used elsewhere — Key Rules, Still Need/In Closet), each showing
item count and running total in the header even when collapsed; Pending starts open,
Purchased starts closed (Purchased reads "None yet" when empty), using the same
`priceSummary()` totals rule as the Wardrobe. Any want can be marked **High priority**
in its edit form: high-priority items get a "High" badge and sort first (then cheapest,
unpriced last), and Home's "Up next" picks by the same order. Links now point to direct
product pages (Amazon,
Dick's, Rack Room Shoes, Instant Pot's own site) picked to match the noted spec
(color/size) as closely as possible from search results — retailer sites block
automated fetch/scrape verification (403s across the board, the same issue the
original build hit trying to capture a Dick's cart-share link), so double-check size,
color, and current price at checkout before buying. The brown belt still has no link;
its price is a rough estimate pending the merge decision below.

## Known open items / suggested next steps
1. Search/filter for the capsule list (explicitly deferred, not built)
2. The brown belt merge question (Wants list vs. style capsule "still need") is now
   trivially self-serve — delete whichever entry is redundant in edit mode
3. Wash day's biweekly cadence/anchor date isn't exposed in edit mode (it's a computed
   rule, not a list item) — still requires a code change if the schedule shifts
4. To-dos have no due dates/times/notifications (unlike the Android Reminders app they
   were modeled after) — deliberately kept to plain text + checkbox; revisit if that
   turns out to be missed
5. Home's Today card short names (`STEP_SHORT_NAMES` — "Cleanser", "Ascorbyl
   Glucoside," etc.) are a code-side lookup keyed by step label, not editable in-app;
   a step label with no match in the table just falls back to showing the label
   itself, which still requires a code change to add new mappings

## User context (for tone/preferences if continuing this project)
Goes by Jazz, Charlotte NC, business casual job, "Glow Up Season" self-improvement
project. Prefers Claude to make judgment calls and show finished output rather than
asking permission upfront; gives targeted correction rather than wanting full rewrites.
Aesthetic: clean, minimal, masculine-leaning.
