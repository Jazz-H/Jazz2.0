# Jazz 2.0 — Personal Dashboard PWA

An installable mobile web app that pulls the Jazz 2.0 series (originally separate Word
docs) into one place with five tabs: **Home, To-Do, Skin & Hair, Wardrobe, Wants.**

Live at **https://jazz-h.github.io/Jazz2.0/** (GitHub Pages, deployed from `main`).

## Using the app

**Home** is a dashboard. It has:
- a To-Do summary of overdue and due-today items (up to 3), which you can tick off in place;
- today's skin routine progress ("AM 4/6 · PM 0/6"), the streak, and the next wash day;
- Wardrobe and Wants stat tiles;
- **Up next**: the top two items to buy, by priority then price.

Tapping a card opens its tab.

**To-Do** is the full list.
- **Adding.** Use the quick-add box. A trailing day word sets the due date ("dentist fri",
  "call mom tomorrow"), and a "Due Friday ×" chip previews it. Tap × to keep the words as
  plain text instead.
- **Groups.** Overdue (red), Today, Anytime (no date), Tomorrow, the next five weekdays, and
  Later.
- **Completing.** Only the left checkbox completes an item, and a 5-second Undo follows.
  Tapping the text opens the edit form: title, a date picker, and "add sub-items, one per
  line".
- **Other actions.** Star an item to float it to the top of its group. Drag the grip to
  reorder, or to move an item into another date group.
- **Completed.** Finished items sit behind a "N completed" toggle with Restore, Duplicate,
  Delete, and Clear completed. They're archived after 7 days.

**Skin & Hair** is built around doing the routine, not just reading it. Cards, top to bottom:
- **Today:** a checklist of AM and PM steps with done/total counts, the wash-day badge, and
  an N-day streak (days with both AM and PM finished). Check-offs reset daily and sync
  across devices.
- **This week:** Mon–Sun rows showing only what differs from the base routine
  ("Exfoliate", "Wash day"). Tap a day for its full list.
- **Routine:** the one place to edit the AM, PM, and wash-day PM steps. A step can be
  limited to certain days with a Mon–Sun chip picker. New steps go before any
  "… — last step" entry, so SPF and lash serum stay last.
- **Key rules:** the routine's ground rules.

Wash day falls on every other Thursday, anchored to Thu Jul 16 2026 (`WASH_DAY_ANCHOR`), and
its PM routine replaces the regular PM routine.

**Wardrobe** is the closet.
- **Wardrobe built:** progress, counting closet items against wardrobe items still to buy.
- **Shopping link:** "N wardrobe items to buy · Shopping list →" opens Wants filtered to
  Wardrobe.
- **In closet:** grouped by category, with "fit pending" badges.
- **Reference cards:** Fit rules and the Sizing grid.

**Wants** is the single shopping list, clothes included.
- **Filtering.** All / Wardrobe / Other chips narrow the list.
- **Categories.** Each item's form has a Category select: Not clothing, or a wardrobe
  category. Clothing items show a "Wardrobe · Tops" tag.
- **Buying.** Mark bought moves the item to Purchased. A bought wardrobe item also appears in
  the closet; un-buying takes it back out.
- **Priority.** High-priority items get a badge and sort first.

**Editing.** Each editable card has its own **Edit** chip. With it on, rows become tappable
to edit or delete, and "+ Add …" rows appear. Edit forms are a bottom sheet on phones and
a centered dialog on desktop. Esc closes them, Enter saves, and Delete always confirms first.

**Navigation.**
- **Tab bar:** at the bottom on phones. At ≥768px it moves under the header, with a centered
  column (760px, or 920px at ≥1440px).
- **Swiping:** swipe left or right to switch tabs.
- **Hard refresh:** pull down from the top of a tab (or use the refresh button on
  desktop). It clears the service worker cache and reloads, but never touches your data.
- **Home-screen shortcuts:** long-press the installed icon for Add a to-do, Today's
  routine, Wardrobe, and Wants. These come from `shortcuts` in `manifest.json`, handled
  by `applyLaunchParams()`.

## Project layout

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `jazz2.0.html` | The whole app: HTML, CSS, and JS in one file. No build step, no framework. |
| `index.html` | Redirects the bare site URL to `jazz2.0.html`. |
| `manifest.json` | PWA manifest: name, icons, standalone display, home-screen shortcuts. |
| `sw.js` | Service worker. HTML is network-first so a normal reload picks up new deploys. Icons and the manifest are cache-first. Cross-origin and non-GET requests are never intercepted, so GitHub API calls can't be served stale. |
| `icon-192.png`, `icon-512.png` | App icons. See *Design system*. |
| `tests/regression.mjs` | Regression suite (see *Development*). |
| `package.json` | Only holds the test dependency (Playwright). The app itself needs no install. |
| `.github/workflows/test.yml` | Runs the suite on every PR and every push to `main`. |

### How `jazz2.0.html` is organized
1. **CSS:** `:root` theme tokens, base components, to-do and routine styles, hover styles
   (mouse only), then the desktop media queries.
2. **Markup:** header (title, date, Sync & backup button, desktop refresh button), five
   empty `tabpanel` sections, the toast, the modal, and the tab bar.
3. **Script**, roughly top to bottom:
   - constants and icons;
   - storage and escaping helpers;
   - the default data;
   - the modal engine;
   - one `render*` function per tab (`renderHome` updates both Home and To-Do);
   - feature logic (to-do dates, routine, wardrobe/wants, sync, backup);
   - init.

## Development

**Run locally.** Serve the folder over HTTP, for example with `python3 -m http.server`, and
open `/jazz2.0.html`. The service worker only registers on `https:` or `localhost`.

**Test.** Run:

```sh
npm install
npx playwright install chromium   # or set CHROMIUM_PATH to an existing Chromium
npm test
```

The suite (54 checks) drives the real app in headless Chromium against a tiny built-in
server. It covers:
- every tab on phone and desktop;
- to-do date parsing, migration, and undo;
- drag between date groups;
- quiet 7-day archiving;
- routine equivalence with the legacy per-day data over 28 dates;
- check-offs and streaks;
- the wardrobe → wants migration and buy-to-closet flow;
- the totals rule;
- backup and restore;
- sync against a mocked Gist API;
- XSS hardening.

CI runs the suite on every PR.

**Ship.** Merge to `main` and GitHub Pages deploys it. When cached assets change, bump
`CACHE_NAME` in `sw.js` so installed copies refresh them. The HTML itself is network-first.

**Conventions worth keeping:**
- **Stored data is untrusted.** It can arrive from sync or a backup file. Render text with
  `escapeHtml`/`escapeAttr`, and links with `linkHtml()`, which only allows `http(s)`.
  `normalizeLoadedData()` gives a fresh id to any id that isn't a plain token, because ids
  are interpolated into inline `onclick` handlers.
- **User actions vs. housekeeping.**
  - User actions save with `saveContent()`, which bumps the sync timestamp.
  - Housekeeping (migrations, auto-archive) saves with `writeQuietly()`, which doesn't.
  - Why: housekeeping that bumps the timestamp makes a stale device look newest, so its
    sync overwrites real edits from the other device.
- **Migrations are deterministic.** They derive ids from content, so every device converts
  old data identically. They also run on synced and restored data, via `applyRemote()`.
- **Collapsible cards** use `collapsibleCard()`; the icons are `BOX_CHECK_SVG`,
  `CHEVRON_DOWN`, and `glanceArrow()`.

## Data and storage

Everything lives in `localStorage` on the device:

| Key | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `todo-content` | To-dos: `{id, text, done, due: "YYYY-MM-DD" \| null, starred, subitems, completedAt}` |
| `todo-archive-content` | Completed to-dos older than 7 days (newest 200) |
| `skin-routine-content` | `{washDay, am, pm, washPm}`; steps are `{id, label, product, note?, days?}`, where `days` uses weekday numbers and 0 = Sun |
| `routine-checks` | Daily check-offs by date: `{am: [ids], pm: [ids], amDone, pmDone}`, about 60 days kept |
| `skin-rules-content`, `style-rules-content`, `sizes-content` | Reference lists |
| `capsule-content` | Owned closet items (`state: "owned" \| "pending"` for fit pending) |
| `wants-content` | Shopping list: `{id, name, meta, price, link, estimated?, priority?, wardrobeCat?}` |
| `wants-state` | Bought flags, by want id |
| `data-updated-at` | Last real edit, used for sync |
| `sync-token`, `sync-gist-id` | Sync settings for this device (never synced) |

Lists still on their built-in defaults have no key until first edited.

**Legacy formats, converted automatically on load and on synced or restored data:**
- **To-dos:** a weekday name in `day` → a real `due` date.
- **Skin routine:** seven per-day copies (`skin-days-content`) → one routine, via
  `routineFromDays()`.
- **Wardrobe:** "needed" capsule items plus `style-state` toggles → Wants items with
  `wardrobeCat`, via `migrateWardrobeNeeds()`.
- **Escaped text:** HTML entities (`&amp;`) in stored text → plain text.

**Sync (opt-in).** Tap the cloud button, paste a **classic** GitHub token with only the
`gist` scope, and do this on each device. Fine-grained tokens can't use the Gist API.
- **Storage:** all lists live as one JSON file in a private gist.
- **Timing:** the app pushes about 1.5s after each edit, and pulls on load and whenever
  it returns to the foreground.
- **Conflicts:** the newest edit wins.

**Backup.** The same dialog has **Download backup** and **Restore…**.
- **Format:** one JSON file containing the full live value of every list.
- **Sync not required:** works whether or not sync is on.
- **Download:** uses the share sheet on mobile.
- **Restore:** asks for confirmation, then counts as an edit, so it syncs.

## Design system

**Theme.** "Graphite": a neutral charcoal ground with a soft-white primary accent, pastel
blue for AM, and pastel pink for PM. Every color comes from the `:root` tokens, so a theme
change only touches that block, plus `theme-color` in the HTML and `manifest.json`. The
token names are historical:
- `--gold`: AM;
- `--navy`: PM;
- `--olive`: the primary accent;
- `--link`: links.

**Icons.**
- **Design:** a charcoal terminal-window card with a blue→pink "J", a raised "2.0", and a
  white cursor block.
- **Safe zone:** the card sits 17% in from the edge to stay inside Android's maskable-icon
  safe zone.
- **Source:** generated with Pillow at 2048px, then downsampled.

**Touch.** Rows and controls use ~44px touch targets. Text inputs are 16px on touch
devices so iOS doesn't zoom.

## Known limitations and ideas
- **No notifications.** A static web page can't wake itself up to alert you, and iOS
  blocks this even for installed PWAs. The planned workaround is "Add to calendar" on
  dated to-dos (an `.ics` file with an alarm).
- **Wash-day cadence** (every other Thursday) is a code constant, not editable in the app.
- **Home's short step names** (`STEP_SHORT_NAMES`) are a code lookup. Unmapped labels fall
  back to the full label.
- **Sync push replaces the gist file.** A device on an outdated app version can drop keys
  it doesn't know about until it updates.

## User context (for tone/preferences if continuing this project)
Goes by Jazz, Charlotte NC, business casual job, "Glow Up Season" self-improvement
project. Prefers Claude to make judgment calls and show finished output rather than
asking permission upfront; gives targeted correction rather than wanting full rewrites.
Aesthetic: clean, minimal, masculine-leaning.
