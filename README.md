# Jazz 2.0 — Personal Dashboard PWA

An installable mobile web app that pulls the Jazz 2.0 series (originally separate Word
docs) into one place with five tabs: **Home, To-Do, Shopping, Budget, Skin & Hair.**
The wardrobe (closet, sizes, fit rules) lives inside Shopping, behind its **To buy | Closet** switch.

Live at **https://jazz-h.github.io/Jazz2.0/** (GitHub Pages, deployed from `main`).

## Using the app

**Home** is a day planner.
- **Calendar strip:** a Monday-first week with dots for what's due and a droplet on wash
  days. Swipe it sideways (or ‹ ›) for other weeks; swipe down (or tap the grab bar) for the
  full month. Any date can be picked; **Today** jumps back.
- **Day hero:** the date, a done/total progress ring, and what's left.
- **Day list:** Overdue, the day's to-dos (starred first, finished ones struck through),
  bills due ("Pay Rent · $1,450"), the Wash hair item on wash days, future repeats of
  recurring to-dos and bills, and an Anytime peek on today. Everything can be ticked in place.

**To-Do** is the full list.
- **Adding.** Tap the floating **+** button (on Home and To-Do; see *Adding things* below).
  The **New to-do** form opens with the keyboard up:
  - **Text box:** a trailing day word sets the date ("dentist fri"), lighting up its pill;
    tap that pill to keep the words as plain text instead.
  - **Pills:** Today, Tomorrow, This weekend, Pick date (native date picker), Star, and
    Sub-items (one per line).
  - **Many in a row:** Enter (or Add to-do) saves and clears the form; the header counts
    "2 added · last for Friday". Close it with ×, a tap outside, a swipe down, or Esc.
  - The "Add a to-do" home-screen shortcut opens the form directly. To-dos are capped at
    200 characters.
- **Groups.** Overdue (red), Today, Anytime (no date), Tomorrow, the next five weekdays, and
  Later.
- **Completing.** Only the left checkbox completes an item, and a 5-second Undo follows.
  Tapping the text opens the edit form: title, a date picker, and "add sub-items, one per
  line".
- **Other actions.** Star an item to float it to the top of its group. Drag the grip to
  reorder, or to move an item into another date group.
- **Completed.** Finished items sit behind a "N completed" toggle with Restore, Duplicate,
  Delete, and Clear completed. They're archived after 7 days.

**Skin & Hair** is built around doing the routine, not just reading it. Cards, top to bottom:
- **Today:** a checklist of AM and PM steps with done/total counts, the wash-day badge, and
  an N-day streak (days with both AM and PM finished). Check-offs reset daily and sync
  across devices.
- **This week:** Mon–Sun rows showing only what differs from the base routine
  ("Exfoliate", "Wash day"). Tap a day for its full list.
- **Wash day:** pick a frequency (every week, 10 days, 2, 3, or 4 weeks) and tap any date
  on the month calendar to make it a wash day. The schedule repeats from that date, and
  wash days are highlighted. Each change shows an Undo.
- **Routine:** the one place to edit the AM, PM, and wash-day PM steps. A step can be
  limited to certain days with a Mon–Sun chip picker. New steps go before any
  "… — last step" entry, so SPF and lash serum stay last.
- **Key rules:** the routine's ground rules. The card is hidden while the list is empty.

On wash days, the wash-day PM routine replaces the regular PM routine. The schedule is
stored on the routine as `wash: {anchor, everyDays}`. Routines saved before it was editable
fall back to the original cadence: every 2 weeks from Thu Jul 16 2026.

**Closet** (Shopping → Closet; the `style` panel in code) is the wardrobe.
- **Wardrobe built:** progress, counting closet items against wardrobe items still to buy.
- **Shopping link:** "N wardrobe items to buy · Shopping list →" opens Wants filtered to
  Wardrobe.
- **In closet:** grouped by category, with "fit pending" badges.
- **Reference cards:** Fit rules and the Sizing grid.

**Shopping** (the `wants` tab in code; renamed from "Wants") is the single shopping list:
clothes, moto gear, and everything else.
- **Need or want.** Every item carries a **Need** or **Want** tag. Unless set in its form,
  wardrobe items count as needs and everything else as wants. Needs sort ahead of wants,
  after high-priority items.
- **Adding.** The **+** button opens the New item sheet (see *Adding things*).
- **Filtering.** All / Needs / Wants / Wardrobe / Moto chips narrow the list. They sit
  in one row that scrolls sideways (no scrollbar; on phones it runs to the screen edges
  with a fade on the right), and the selected chip stays in view. Quick-adding under
  a filter keeps the new item in it.
- **Categories.** Each item's form has a Category select: General, **Moto** (motorcycle
  gear, `moto: true`, shown with a "Moto" tag), or a wardrobe category (`wardrobeCat`,
  shown as "Wardrobe · Tops"). They're mutually exclusive.
- **Buying.** Mark bought moves the item to Purchased. A bought wardrobe item also appears in
  the closet; un-buying takes it back out.
- **Priority.** High-priority items get a badge and sort first.

**Budget** tracks bills and spending, one calendar month at a time (‹ › to step months).
- **Summary:** left to spend (category budgets minus spending), spent vs. budget, and bills
  due vs. paid.
- **Bills:** each has an amount, a due date, a repeat (monthly, weekly, every 2 weeks,
  quarterly, yearly, one time), Autopay, and an optional pay link. Tick one to mark it paid:
  the payment is logged and the bill moves to its next due date (Undo, or untick the paid
  row, takes it back). Later dues in the month are projected. Bills also show on Home.
- **Spending:** expenses logged against monthly category limits (Groceries, Dining out, Gas,
  Fun, Other by default; the Edit chip adds, renames, re-limits, or deletes them). Tap a
  category for its expenses; over-limit categories turn red.
- Payments and expenses older than about 13 months are pruned automatically.

**Adding things.** A floating **+** button on Home, To-Do, Shopping, Closet, and Budget opens one
shared bottom sheet whose fields fit the tab:
- **To-do** (Home, To-Do): described under To-Do above.
- **Shopping → New item:** a trailing price in the text sets it ("helmet $250", tap the
  price pill to keep it as text), plus Need / Want, General / Moto / Wardrobe (with a
  Tops, Bottoms… row), High priority, and Details (notes, price, link). New items start in
  whatever the filter is showing, and the category sticks between adds for batches.
- **Closet → Add to wardrobe:** In closet or To buy (which lands on Shopping), a category
  row, Fit pending, and Notes.
- **Budget → Add to budget:** Expense or Bill. A trailing amount in the text sets it
  ("groceries $54") or use the Amount box. Expenses take a date (Today, Yesterday, Pick date)
  and a category; bills take a due date, a repeat, Autopay, and a pay link.

Every mode adds several in a row: Enter saves and clears, and the header counts the adds.
Skin & Hair has no + because adding routine steps is a rare edit there.

**Editing.** Each editable card has its own **Edit** chip. With it on, rows become tappable
to edit or delete, and "+ Add …" rows appear for rules, sizes, sub-items, and routine steps
(new to-dos, shopping items, and closet items come from the + button). Edit forms are a bottom sheet on phones and
a centered dialog on desktop. Esc closes them, Enter saves, and Delete always confirms first.

**Navigation.**
- **Tab bar:** at the bottom on phones. At ≥768px it moves under the header, with a centered
  column (760px, or 920px at ≥1440px).
- **Swiping:** swipe left or right to switch tabs, in tab-bar order (`TAB_ORDER`).
- **Hard refresh:** pull down from the top of a tab (or use the refresh button on
  desktop). It clears the service worker cache and reloads, but never touches your data.
- **Home-screen shortcuts:** long-press the installed icon for Add a to-do, Shopping,
  Budget, and Today's routine. These come from `shortcuts` in `manifest.json`, handled
  by `applyLaunchParams()`.

## Project layout

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `jazz2.0.html` | The whole app: HTML, CSS, and JS in one file. No build step, no framework. |
| `index.html` | Redirects the bare site URL to `jazz2.0.html`. |
| `manifest.json` | PWA manifest: name, icons, standalone display, home-screen shortcuts. |
| `sw.js` | Service worker. HTML is network-first so a normal reload picks up new deploys. Icons and the manifest are cache-first. Cross-origin and non-GET requests are never intercepted, so GitHub API calls can't be served stale. |
| `icon-192.png`, `icon-512.png` | App icons. See *Design system*. |
| `tests/regression.mjs` | Regression suite (see *Development*). |
| `package.json` | Only holds the test dependency (Playwright). The app itself needs no install. |
| `.github/workflows/test.yml` | Runs the suite on every PR and every push to `main`. |

### How `jazz2.0.html` is organized
1. **CSS:** `:root` theme tokens, base components, to-do and routine styles, hover styles
   (mouse only), then the desktop media queries.
2. **Markup:** header (title, date, Sync & backup button, desktop refresh button), five
   empty `tabpanel` sections, the toast, the modal, and the tab bar.
3. **Script**, roughly top to bottom:
   - constants and icons;
   - storage and escaping helpers;
   - the default data;
   - the modal engine;
   - one `render*` function per tab (`renderHome` updates both Home and To-Do);
   - feature logic (to-do dates, routine, wardrobe/wants, sync, backup);
   - init.

## Development

**Run locally.** Serve the folder over HTTP, for example with `python3 -m http.server`, and
open `/jazz2.0.html`. The service worker only registers on `https:` or `localhost`.

**Test.** Run:

```sh
npm install
npx playwright install chromium   # or set CHROMIUM_PATH to an existing Chromium
npm test
```

The suite (100 checks) drives the real app in headless Chromium against a tiny built-in
server. It covers:
- every tab on phone and desktop;
- the + sheet in all three modes (to-do dates and sub-items, shopping price/category/details,
  wardrobe closet vs. to-buy, batches, per-tab button);
- to-do date parsing, migration, and undo;
- drag between date groups;
- quiet 7-day archiving;
- routine equivalence with the legacy per-day data over 28 dates;
- check-offs and streaks;
- the wash-day calendar and frequency;
- need/want tags, the Moto category, and the Shopping rename;
- the wardrobe → wants migration and buy-to-closet flow;
- the totals rule;
- backup and restore;
- sync against a mocked Gist API;
- XSS hardening.

CI runs the suite on every PR.

**Ship.** Merge to `main` and GitHub Pages deploys it. When cached assets change, bump
`CACHE_NAME` in `sw.js` so installed copies refresh them. The HTML itself is network-first.

**Conventions worth keeping:**
- **Stored data is untrusted.** It can arrive from sync or a backup file. Render text with
  `escapeHtml`/`escapeAttr`, and links with `linkHtml()`, which only allows `http(s)`.
  `normalizeLoadedData()` gives a fresh id to any id that isn't a plain token, because ids
  are interpolated into inline `onclick` handlers.
- **User actions vs. housekeeping.**
  - User actions save with `saveContent()`, which bumps the sync timestamp.
  - Housekeeping (migrations, auto-archive) saves with `writeQuietly()`, which doesn't.
  - Why: housekeeping that bumps the timestamp makes a stale device look newest, so its
    sync overwrites real edits from the other device.
- **Migrations are deterministic.** They derive ids from content, so every device converts
  old data identically. They also run on synced and restored data, via `applyRemote()`.
- **Collapsible cards** use `collapsibleCard()`; the icons are `BOX_CHECK_SVG`,
  `CHEVRON_DOWN`, and `glanceArrow()`.

## Data and storage

Everything lives in `localStorage` on the device:

| Key | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `todo-content` | To-dos: `{id, text, done, due: "YYYY-MM-DD" \| null, starred, subitems, completedAt}` |
| `todo-archive-content` | Completed to-dos older than 7 days (newest 200) |
| `skin-routine-content` | `{am, pm, washPm, wash?: {anchor, everyDays}}`; steps are `{id, label, product, note?, days?}`, where `days` uses weekday numbers and 0 = Sun |
| `routine-checks` | Daily check-offs by date: `{am: [ids], pm: [ids], amDone, pmDone}`, about 60 days kept |
| `skin-rules-content`, `style-rules-content`, `sizes-content` | Reference lists |
| `capsule-content` | Owned closet items (`state: "owned" \| "pending"` for fit pending) |
| `wants-content` | Shopping list: `{id, name, meta, price, link, estimated?, priority?, kind?: "need" \| "want", wardrobeCat?, moto?}` |
| `wants-state` | Bought flags, by want id |
| `bills-content` | Bills: `{id, name, amount, due, repeat, autopay, link, done?}` (`done` = a paid one-time bill) |
| `bill-payments` | Payments: `{id, billId, name, amount, due, date}` (`due` = the due date it covered) |
| `budget-content` | `{categories: [{id, name, limit}], expenses: [{id, name, amount, cat, date}]}` |
| `data-updated-at` | Last real edit, used for sync |
| `sync-token`, `sync-gist-id` | Sync settings for this device (never synced) |

Lists still on their built-in defaults have no key until first edited.

**Legacy formats, converted automatically on load and on synced or restored data:**
- **To-dos:** a weekday name in `day` → a real `due` date.
- **Skin routine:** seven per-day copies (`skin-days-content`) → one routine, via
  `routineFromDays()`.
- **Wardrobe:** "needed" capsule items plus `style-state` toggles → Wants items with
  `wardrobeCat`, via `migrateWardrobeNeeds()`.
- **Escaped text:** HTML entities (`&amp;`) in stored text → plain text.

**Sync (opt-in).** Tap the cloud button, paste a **classic** GitHub token with only the
`gist` scope, and do this on each device. Fine-grained tokens can't use the Gist API.
- **Storage:** all lists live as one JSON file in a private gist.
- **Timing:** the app pushes about 1.5s after each edit, and pulls on load and whenever
  it returns to the foreground.
- **Conflicts:** the newest edit wins.

**Backup.** The same dialog has **Download backup** and **Restore…**.
- **Format:** one JSON file containing the full live value of every list.
- **Sync not required:** works whether or not sync is on.
- **Download:** uses the share sheet on mobile.
- **Restore:** asks for confirmation, then counts as an edit, so it syncs.

## Design system

**Theme.** "Graphite": a neutral charcoal ground with a soft-white primary accent, pastel
blue for AM, and pastel pink for PM. Every color comes from the `:root` tokens, so a theme
change only touches that block, plus `theme-color` in the HTML and `manifest.json`. The
token names are historical:
- `--gold`: AM;
- `--navy`: PM;
- `--olive`: the primary accent;
- `--link`: links.

**Icons.**
- **Design:** a charcoal terminal-window card with a blue→pink "J", a raised "2.0", and a
  white cursor block.
- **Safe zone:** the card sits 17% in from the edge to stay inside Android's maskable-icon
  safe zone.
- **Source:** generated with Pillow at 2048px, then downsampled.

**Touch.** Rows and controls use ~44px touch targets. Text inputs are 16px on touch
devices so iOS doesn't zoom.

## Known limitations and ideas
- **No notifications.** A static web page can't wake itself up to alert you, and iOS
  blocks this even for installed PWAs. The planned workaround is "Add to calendar" on
  dated to-dos (an `.ics` file with an alarm).
- **Home's short step names** (`STEP_SHORT_NAMES`) are a code lookup. Unmapped labels fall
  back to the full label.
- **Sync push replaces the gist file.** A device on an outdated app version can drop keys
  it doesn't know about until it updates.

## User context (for tone/preferences if continuing this project)
Goes by Jazz, Charlotte NC, business casual job, "Glow Up Season" self-improvement
project. Prefers Claude to make judgment calls and show finished output rather than
asking permission upfront; gives targeted correction rather than wanting full rewrites.
Aesthetic: clean, minimal, masculine-leaning.
