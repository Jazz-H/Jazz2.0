# Jazz 2.0 — Personal Dashboard PWA

A single-file mobile web app consolidating the Jazz 2.0 series (previously separate
Word docs) into one tabbed, installable PWA: **Home, Skin/Hair, Style, Wants.**

## Files
- `index.html` — redirects to `jazz2.0.html`, so the bare repo root URL works instead
  of falling through to GitHub Pages' auto-rendered README
- `jazz2.0.html` — the entire app (HTML/CSS/JS, no build step, no framework)
- `manifest.json` — PWA manifest (name, icons, standalone display)
- `sw.js` — service worker, caches all 6 files for offline use
- `icon-192.png` / `icon-512.png` — generated app icons (true-black terminal-window
  card, gradient "J", raised white-gradient "2.0", blinking cursor block, cyan/magenta/
  lime gradient ring border)

## Status / how to deploy
Live at **https://jazz-h.github.io/Jazz2.0/** (GitHub Pages, deployed from `main` /
root). The manifest + service worker only register on a real http(s) origin, so this
didn't work from a local file or sandboxed preview — now that it's hosted, "Add to
Home Screen" on mobile should work from the URL above.

Home screen icon shortcuts (long-press the installed app icon): **Add a to-do**
(jumps to Home and focuses the quick-add field), **Today's routine** (Skin/Hair, which
then auto-scrolls to today), **Wardrobe** (Style), **Wants**. A true live-data Android
home screen widget isn't possible from a web app — that needs a native app wrapper,
out of scope for this project — so these shortcuts are the PWA equivalent. Implemented
via manifest.json's `shortcuts` array (each pointing at `jazz2.0.html?tab=...`) plus an
`applyLaunchParams()` function in the app that reads `?tab=`/`?action=` on load,
switches tabs accordingly, and strips the query string afterward via
`history.replaceState`.

## Design system
"Neon Nights" theme: true-black ground, bg `#08080b`, surface `#131316`, surface-2
`#1a1a1f`, line `#2c2c34`. Text: `#f4f4f8` primary, `#8d8d9c` dim. Accents: electric
cyan `#00e5ff` (AM / skincare), neon magenta `#ff2e9a` (PM), acid-lime `#c6ff3d`
(primary interactive accent — checkboxes, active tab, progress bar, edit-mode toggle),
danger `#ff3b5c`. Picked from five options mocked up side-by-side against the real
components before committing — see chat history if revisiting the palette. App icons:
a plain terminal-window card (rounded square, no border, three status dots) with a
"J2.0" wordmark in a monospace font — the "J" in a cyan→magenta gradient fill, "2.0"
smaller and raised like an exponent with its own white→soft-gray gradient for a bit of
depth, plus a solid cyan cursor block after it. The card sits at 17% margin from the
canvas edge (not the ~9% of earlier drafts) — Android's maskable-icon safe zone is
roughly the center 66%-diameter circle, and the tighter margin was getting its corners
cropped and looking "zoomed in" next to other home-screen icons once actually installed
on a phone. Went through several rounds (flat "J2" → glowing lime "J2.0" → gradient-
ring-bordered terminal card → this, border removed) — see chat history if revisiting.
- Bottom tab bar (app-style), swipe left/right between tabs supported
- Pull-to-refresh (swipe down from the top of a tab) triggers a hard refresh — clears
  the service worker's cache and unregisters it before reloading, so it can't serve
  stale cached assets (native browser pull-to-refresh is disabled via
  `overscroll-behavior-y:none` so this custom one doesn't fight with it)
- Service worker uses network-first for the HTML shell (`jazz2.0.html`/`index.html`)
  and cache-first for static assets (icons, manifest) — first ship of the service
  worker was cache-first for everything, which meant a stale cached copy of the app
  could keep serving itself indefinitely (including hiding fixes shipped after it,
  like pull-to-refresh itself not working until this was fixed); registration also
  passes `updateViaCache: "none"` so the browser always re-checks `sw.js` itself for
  changes instead of caching it for up to 24h
- Standardized chevron pattern for ALL collapsible sections (rules cards, day
  accordions, capsule need/owned cards) — same SVG path, same 180° rotate-on-open
  behavior
- Every collapsible section shows an "insight" (count/progress) in its header,
  except the Skin/Hair day accordions — the AM/PM step-count insight was removed
  per user preference
- Desktop layout (`@media (min-width: 768px)`, CSS-only): the tab bar moves from the
  bottom to a horizontal bar under the header (icon + label side by side, lime
  underline on the active tab), and header/tabs/content align on one centered 760px
  column instead of stretching full-width; edit modals center on screen instead of
  bottom-sheeting. Phone layout is untouched below the breakpoint

## Editing
Every list in the app — Skin/Hair rules and AM/PM steps, Style fit rules/sizing/capsule
items, Wants items — is fully editable in-app: add, edit, and delete, no code changes
needed. Tap the pencil icon top-right of the header to enter edit mode. While it's on:
- Rows with no existing tap action (rules, skin/hair steps, sizing) become tappable —
  tap anywhere on the row to edit or delete it.
- Rows that already have a primary tap action (capsule owned/needed toggle, wants
  mark-bought) get a small separate pencil button so editing doesn't collide with
  that action.
- "+ Add …" buttons appear at the bottom of every list (Skin/Hair's 7 weekdays are NOT
  addable/removable, since "today" and wash-day detection depend on the fixed Mon–Sun
  set matching real calendar weekdays).
- New AM steps are inserted before the last step if that step's label contains "last
  step" (so SPF/lash-serum ordering rules stay intact automatically).
- Edits use a bottom-sheet modal with Save/Delete; deleting always confirms first.
Edit mode itself persists across reloads (`edit-mode` in localStorage).

## Data / storage
Two layers, both plain `localStorage`, both survive a hard refresh (pull-to-refresh
only clears the service worker's cache, never localStorage):
- **Content** (the editable lists themselves): `skin-rules-content`, `skin-days-content`,
  `style-rules-content`, `sizes-content`, `capsule-content`, `wants-content`,
  `todo-content`. Each seeds from the built-in defaults on first run (`todo-content`
  seeds empty — no default to-dos), then persists whatever the user edits it to.
- **State** (checkbox/toggle state, keyed by item id): `style-state`, `wants-state`.
  (Originally used `window.storage`, an artifact-only API from Claude's in-browser
  preview environment; migrated to `localStorage` now that the app runs on its own
  hosted origin — this also resolved the intermittent "Storage set failed" errors,
  since saves no longer go through Anthropic's artifact storage bridge at all.)

Removing the Fitness tab left `fitness-days-content` and `fitness-state` as orphaned
keys in any browser that had already loaded the app — harmless (nothing reads them
anymore), not actively cleaned up.

## Tab-by-tab content
**Home:** The default landing tab.

*To-Do* — plain-text quick-add (type + Enter, no modal, mirrors the Wants quick-add
pattern and the gist of the Android Reminders "type a new line" flow), tap the circle
to check off. Items are grouped under day headers — "This week" (the default bucket
for anything quick-added, no day assigned) plus Monday–Sunday, only showing groups
that have items; within a group, starred items float to the top. Tap the pencil on any
item to rename it and/or assign it to a day (or back to "This week") via a small modal,
which doubles as the delete flow. A header badge shows "N open" (or "All done" / "All
done for now" once every item in the active list is checked off) counting across all
groups. No default/seed items — it's empty until you add your own.

Each to-do also carries a couple of Android-Reminders-style extras, scoped down from
the full Reminders feature set to what's realistic in an installable web app with no
push-notification backend (see the "What this app can't do" note below): a **star**
toggle (cyan when active) that pins the item to the top of its day-group, and a
**sub-checklist** toggle (the small list icon, with a live "done/total" badge once it
has items) that expands an inline mini checklist under the row — its own add-input,
per-item checkboxes, and a × to delete a sub-item, all independent of the parent
to-do's own completion state. Checking a to-do off no longer deletes it or just sinks
it in place — it moves into a collapsible **Completed** card below the active list,
showing the completion date; unchecking it there moves it right back (that's the
"Restore"), and each row also has **Duplicate** (clones it as a fresh open item,
including a fresh copy of its sub-items) and **Delete** (permanent, confirms first)
icon buttons. A red-outlined "Clear completed" button at the bottom of that card
bulk-deletes everything in it.

*What this app can't do:* a real Reminders app can alert you at a specific time or when
you arrive somewhere, because it's a native app with OS-level background access. This
is a static installable web page with no server — there's no reliable way for it to
wake up and fire a notification while it isn't open (iOS Safari blocks this almost
entirely even when "installed" to the home screen), so due-time alerts and
location-based reminders were deliberately left out rather than half-built.

*Glance cards* — tappable cards summarizing the other tabs and jumping straight to them
on tap, each with a colored icon badge for quick visual identity: **Today** (cyan
leaf/droplet badge — today's AM/PM steps from Skin/Hair, listed by a short display
name — a middle ground between the vague step category ("Eye area") and the full
product name with its concentration ("Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG"): "Cleanser,
Ascorbyl Glucoside, Niacinamide, Moisturizer, Hair mist, Sunscreen" — each list under a
small colored AM/PM tag — cyan for AM, magenta for PM, matching the accent colors used
for the actual AM/PM bands on the Skin/Hair tab — plus a wash-day badge on wash
Thursdays, or otherwise a highlighted "Next wash day: [date] — in N days" callout (a
magenta-tinted pill with a droplet icon, matching the PM accent color, so it stands out
from the rest of the card instead of reading as another dim detail line)), full-width
as before.

Below that, **Wardrobe** (lime shirt badge) and **Wants** (magenta bag badge) sit side
by side in a compact two-column stat-tile grid rather than stacking full-width — this
fills what used to be dead space at the bottom of Home and gives each card a distinct
accent color at a glance. Wardrobe shows owned% as the headline stat (with the
owned/total count as a caption) over a cyan→lime gradient progress bar, plus a "still
need" teaser naming the *cheapest* still-needed item by price when any needed items
have a price set, otherwise just the first one. Wants shows the pending dollar total as
the headline stat (with the pending count as a caption), plus a "next" teaser naming
the cheapest pending item. Both teasers truncate the item name to one line so the price
never gets crowded out, and both carry the same pair of inline icon-only actions at a
36px tap target (bumped up from an initial 28px, which measured under the ~44px
minimum touch-target guideline): a mark-owned/mark-bought checkmark button (olive), and
— only when that item has a link saved — a link-shortcut button in cyan, so it reads as
a distinctly different action from the checkmark rather than a second, easy-to-miss
duplicate; both glyphs share the same stroke width so they read as a matched pair. All
tiles re-render every time you land on Home, so they never show stale numbers from
something you changed on another tab.

The Skin/Hair, Wardrobe, and Wants tabs each carry a small colored icon badge next to
their header title (cyan droplet, lime shirt, magenta bag) matching the accent used for
their Home glance card, for visual continuity across the app.

**Skin/Hair:** Mon–Sun day-by-day accordion, gold AM band / navy PM band per day,
auto-detects and opens "today," badges it, and auto-scrolls the tab straight to
today's card on open — no hunting for it further down the week. Key rules card
(Vitamin C/Glycolic Acid
same-day-different-session rule, SPF always last AM step, lash serum always last PM
step). Hair mist (Locsanity Passion Fruit Daily Spray, standardized from the old
Mielle oil seal-and-oil / Lion Locs / rice water rotation) runs twice daily — once in
AM (before SPF, which stays the final AM step) and once in PM — every day of the week.
Wash day (Dollylocks shampoo + Mielle mask) runs biweekly on Thursday (moved from
Saturday), not every week — last wash was Thu Jul 16, 2026, next Thu Jul 30, badged
"Wash day" on the Thursdays it lands on; off-weeks get the regular AM/PM routine
instead (wash-day PM swaps in the shampoo + mask in place of the mist, since that
already covers hair care for the day). The anchor date and weekday are both plain
constants in the code (`WASH_DAY_ANCHOR`, and the day-of-week math around it) — still
requires a code change if either shifts again, same as before.

**Style:** Tab bar button still says "Style"; the in-tab header now reads "Wardrobe"
(renamed from "Style Capsule" — the tab bar already says Style, so the header just
names what's actually in the tab instead of repeating it). Fit rules card (front-tuck,
Tall/Long inseam, size-to-hips, no oversized/drop-shoulder, ankle dress pants = business
casual only w/ no-show socks + loafers never sneakers). Sizing reference grid (Tops
XS–S, Outerwear XXS, Bottoms 4 Tall/Long, Denim 4/27 Long, Shoes 7.5M, Ring 5–7 w/
footnote: Oura confirmed at 7). Wardrobe: "Still need" and "In closet" as separate
collapsible cards, both grouped by category (Tops/Bottoms/Shoes/Outerwear/Accessories),
tappable to move between them, persisted. Progress bar ("Wardrobe built") showing % of
items owned. Items support an optional price and link, same shape as Wants (edit-mode
modal, both shown on the item row when set — link as a "View product →" the same style
Wants uses; tapping it stops the tap from also toggling the item owned/needed). The
price mainly exists so Home's "Still need" teaser can surface the cheapest still-needed
item instead of whichever one happens to be first in the list. Only the brown/cognac
belt has a price by default (~$20 est.); everything else is unpriced/unlinked until you
add one. Totals now mirror Wants: each collapsible's header shows item count · $ total
(unpriced items count as $0), a total row sits at the bottom of each list ("Still need
total" / "Owned value"), and a "Wardrobe total" card sits below both, summing everything
with a price across the whole wardrobe.

**Wants:** A quick-add bar sits at the top of the tab, always available regardless of
edit mode — type a name and hit Enter (or tap the + button) to drop a new pending item
straight onto the list with no modal, no price/link required upfront; focus stays in
the field so you can add several in a row. (Edit mode's "+ Add want" still exists for
filling in price/link/notes upfront in one form.) Cytac holster ($24.99), Instant Pot
Duo 3qt ($59.99), North Face Antora
jacket gray XXS ($130, Dick's), Timberland Linden Woods boot black 7.5M ($139.99,
Rack Room), Oura Ring 5 + membership ($468.99), brown leather belt square buckle
(~$20 est., unconfirmed, pending decision on whether to merge with the style capsule's
separate brown/cognac belt line item). Pending and Purchased are collapsible cards
(matching the pattern used elsewhere — Key Rules, Still Need/In Closet), each showing
item count and running total in the header even when collapsed; Pending starts open,
Purchased starts closed. A grand list total sits below both. Links now point to direct
product pages (Amazon,
Dick's, Rack Room Shoes, Instant Pot's own site) picked to match the noted spec
(color/size) as closely as possible from search results — retailer sites block
automated fetch/scrape verification (403s across the board, the same issue the
original build hit trying to capture a Dick's cart-share link), so double-check size,
color, and current price at checkout before buying. The brown belt still has no link;
its price is a rough estimate pending the merge decision below.

## Known open items / suggested next steps
1. Search/filter for the capsule list (explicitly deferred, not built)
2. The brown belt merge question (Wants list vs. style capsule "still need") is now
   trivially self-serve — delete whichever entry is redundant in edit mode
3. Wash day's biweekly cadence/anchor date isn't exposed in edit mode (it's a computed
   rule, not a list item) — still requires a code change if the schedule shifts
4. To-dos have no due dates/times/notifications (unlike the Android Reminders app they
   were modeled after) — deliberately kept to plain text + checkbox; revisit if that
   turns out to be missed
5. Home's Today card short names (`STEP_SHORT_NAMES` — "Cleanser", "Ascorbyl
   Glucoside," etc.) are a code-side lookup keyed by step label, not editable in-app;
   a step label with no match in the table just falls back to showing the label
   itself, which still requires a code change to add new mappings

## User context (for tone/preferences if continuing this project)
Goes by Jazz, Charlotte NC, business casual job, "Glow Up Season" self-improvement
project. Prefers Claude to make judgment calls and show finished output rather than
asking permission upfront; gives targeted correction rather than wanting full rewrites.
Aesthetic: clean, minimal, masculine-leaning.
